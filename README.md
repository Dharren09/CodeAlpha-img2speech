# CodeAlpha Image to Speech Generator

## Description

CodeAlpha Image to Speech Generator is a Python-based tool that allows you to convert text found in images to spoken words. It utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images and then uses a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine to convert the extracted text into audio. It's my first Task as a python intern at CodeAlpha
